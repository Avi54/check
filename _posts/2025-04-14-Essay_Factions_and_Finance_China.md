The reading builds a model to understand China’s financial outcomes. The focus is on
interpreting the emergence of inflationary cycles and inefficiency in capital allocation. The. 
central argument is that factional politics are the key factor influencing economic, financial and
banking policy outcomes.

The author bifurcates two distinct factions, the generalist and technocratic faction. The former
has broad party membership, including provincial leaders, and champions monetary
decentralization. The latter has concentrated membership within the central government and
aims to consolidates power through centralization and monetary tightening, achieved through
the credit plan.

The two factions have an upper hand in different situations. When central planners want growth
they allow decentralization and signal local cadres to increase investment and tolerate not
following the credit plan. Cadres intervene in banking system to convince bankers to provide
loans leading to expansion of credit and money supply. At this junction there is growth
incentive because the cadre evaluation system (pg. 4) rewards provincial leaders that increase
growth as they will be the benefactors of economic goods and in a politically favourable
position. Hence, there exists both a cooperative and competitive spirit. Cooperative as
generalists want decentralization and competitive as each provincial leader wants the highest
growth for their province.

One strength in the author’s argument is that appropriate analogies help elevate the coherence
of the argument. For instance, an apt analogy to the Prisoners Dilemma is used to explain the
decision making between local cadres. The ideal outcome is that the money supply expands at
a sustainable rate in all provinces to consolidate power. However, no provincial leader wants
to be outdone by the other in terms of growth. Faced with this threat, leaders typically decide
to increase money supply to unsustainable levels leading to inflation. The generalists are ill-
equipped to deal with an impending crisis because enforcing guidelines to dampen inflation
among different provinces is difficult. Additionally, they are often unaware of the extent of
inflation as central planners have a monopoly on economic data (pg. 60) which they withhold
because they gain power during a crisis. Thus, the generalists have to voluntarily give power
back to the technocrats who begin posing restrictions on money supply and lending to rein in
inflation. The technocrats now become the dominant faction (pg. 100). This factional rift forms
the basis of the inflationary cycle model.

Quantitative evidence for the model is given which shows that there is strong corelation
between high inflation in one quarter followed by reduced lending in the next quarter signalling
that there was expansion and retrenchment, implying the existence of two factions.
Qualitative evidence for the model is provided by analysing the inflationary cycles when Deng
and Chen played centre stage which shows power swinging between the generalists and the
technocrats. The author cites several qualitative research sources which include interviews with
key leaders, private conversations and speeches never made to the public which give greater
credibility to the argument (pg. 87). Each push for decentralization led to inflation followed by
retrenchment which supports the proposed model. Despite which faction was in power both
exploited the banking system to achieve their policy aims. Fiscalization of the banking meant banks were strong-armed into providing loans which meant that there was no push for reform
or banking autonomy which explains the pervasive problem of high NPL ratio.
Rift between the factions continued in the 2000s between the next set of leaders, Zhu and Jiang.

The Asian Financial Crisis was the key catalyst, which despite not impacting China due to
almost non-existent capital flight, propelled a move towards centralization. Zhu spearheaded a
long overdue banking reform to reduce the number of non-performing loans. This involved
centralizing the Big 4. Central government gained power on who appoints local branch
managers to reduce future NPLs. Existing NPLs were reduced through debt-to-equity swaps
by AMCs (pg. 172). Strict internal accounting standards were enforced for bank branches to
increase transparency.

The “induction-deduction-induction research” approach is extremely fitting and convincing as
a model becomes it demonstrates that there is not only empirical basis for the model but that
once derived it is rigorously testing quantitatively and qualitatively (pg. 15).

Little explanation is provided for certain assumptions like stating that “generalist factions have
an upper hand in allocating resources over central planners (pg. 58). The quantitative model
attempts to verify the existence of factions which is difficult in a non-transparent political
system. It also doesn’t account for the role of smaller factions. The author repeatedly refutes
an ideological basis for financial outcomes (pg. 124) however little evidence and explanation
is provided for this claim making one question the central argument given that on the authors
own admission politics is deeply intertwined with financial affairs. There is little analysis on
the impact of exogenous events in factional politics1 which weakens the central argument since
during the 2000s China become increasingly involved with global trade (WTO)
